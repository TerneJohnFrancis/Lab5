<h2>Battleships</h2>
The main firepower of a naval squadron; these giants with the thickest armor, biggest guns, and considerably long range. High durability allows them to absorb a huge amount of damage, while the big guns allow them to obliterate any opponent with a few well- aimed salvos
Below are the most powerful battleships of the Pacific Theather of War:

    <li>USS Iowa; BB-61</li>

<h2>Fleet Carriers</h2>
The might of a fast-attack group, fleet carriers are unique in their ability to see other ships without being spotted themselves. As a result, their reliance on deck-based aircraft is both their strength and weakness. But when combined with highly effective tactics, fleet carriers become the most devastating ships in the battle group
Shown below are the most prominent fleet carriers in the Pacific Theather of War:
<ul>
    <li>USS Yorktown; CV-5</li>

<h2>Heavy Cruisers</h2>
The vanguard of the battle fleet, heavy cruisers are lighter than battleships but more heavily armored than fleet carriers. Their speed is comparable to that of destroyers, while their anti- aircraft batteries are nearly unmatched in strength and numbers. This gives the heavy cruisers an important position in the fleet, functioning as a movable anti-aircraft shield.
To be displayed here are two prominent heavy cruisers known to have operated in the Pacific Theather of War:
<ul>
    <li>USS San Francisco; CA-38</li>
